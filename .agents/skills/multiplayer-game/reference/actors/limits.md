This page documents the limits for Rivet Actors.

There are two types of limits:

- **Soft Limit**: Application-level limit, configurable in RivetKit. These cannot exceed the hard limit.
- **Hard Limit**: Infrastructure-level limit that cannot be configured.

Soft limits can be configured in RivetKit by passing options to `setup`:

```typescript
import { setup } from "rivetkit";

const rivet = setup({
  use: { /* ... */ },
  maxIncomingMessageSize: 1_048_576,
  maxOutgoingMessageSize: 10_485_760,
  // ...
});
```

## Limits

### WebSocket

These limits affect actions that use `.connect()` and [low-level WebSockets](/docs/actors/websocket-handler).

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max incoming message size | 64 KiB | 32 MiB | Maximum size of incoming WebSocket messages. Soft limit configurable via `maxIncomingMessageSize`. |
| Max outgoing message size | 1 MiB | 32 MiB | Maximum size of outgoing WebSocket messages. Soft limit configurable via `maxOutgoingMessageSize`. |
| WebSocket open timeout | — | 15 seconds | Time allowed for WebSocket connection to be established, including `onBeforeConnect` and `createConnState` hooks. Connection is closed if exceeded. |
| Message ack timeout | — | 30 seconds | Time allowed for message acknowledgment before connection is closed. Only relevant in the case of a network issue and does not affect your application. |

### Hibernating WebSocket

Hibernating WebSockets allow actors to sleep while keeping client connections alive. All WebSocket limits above also apply to hibernating WebSockets. See [WebSocket Hibernation](/docs/actors/websocket-handler#web-socket-hibernation) for details.

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max pending buffer size | — | 128 MiB | Total size of all buffered messages per connection while actor is sleeping. |
| Max pending message count | — | 65,535 | Maximum number of buffered messages per connection while actor is sleeping. |
| Hibernation timeout | — | 90 seconds | Maximum time an actor has to wake up before the client is disconnected. Only relevant if something is wrong with starting actors. |

### HTTP

These limits affect actions that do not use `.connect()` and [low-level HTTP requests](/docs/actors/request-handler).

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max request body size | — | 20 MiB | Maximum size of HTTP request bodies. |
| Max response body size | — | 20 MiB | Maximum size of HTTP response bodies. |
| Request timeout | — | 5 minutes | Maximum time for a request to complete. |

### Networking

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Connection ping timeout | — | 30 seconds | Connection is closed if a ping is not acknowledged within this time. Applies to both HTTP and WebSocket. Only relevant in the case of a network issue and does not affect your application. |

### Queue

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max queue size | 1,000 messages | — | Maximum number of messages in the queue before new messages are rejected. Configurable via `maxQueueSize`. |
| Max queue message size | 64 KiB | 128 KiB (effective) | Maximum size of each individual queue message. Configurable via `maxQueueMessageSize`. Actual payload is slightly lower after queue serialization overhead. |

### Actor KV Storage

These limits apply to the low-level KV storage interface powering Rivet Actors. They likely do not affect your application, but are documented for completeness.

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max key size | — | 2 KiB | Maximum size of a single key. |
| Max value size | — | 128 KiB | Maximum size of a single value. |
| Max keys per operation | — | 128 | Maximum number of keys in a single batch get/put/delete operation. Does not apply to range operations (`listRange`, `deleteRange`). |
| Max batch put payload size | — | 976 KiB | Maximum total size of all key-value pairs in a single batch put operation. |
| Max storage size per actor | — | 10 GiB | Maximum total KV storage size for a single actor. |
| List default limit | — | 16,384 | Default maximum number of keys returned by a list operation. |

### Actor SQLite Storage

These limits apply to the [SQLite database](/docs/actors/state#sqlite-database) available via `this.sql`. SQLite data is stored through the KV layer, so the storage limit is shared with KV storage.

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max storage size per actor | — | 10 GiB | Maximum total storage size for a single actor. This limit is shared with KV storage. |

### KV Preloading

When an actor starts, the engine can pre-fetch KV data declared in the actor name metadata and deliver it alongside the start command. This removes round-trips to storage during actor startup. RivetKit emits the preload manifest from its own key layout and exposes per-actor overrides via `options`. Operators can still enforce a global cap in the [engine config](/docs/self-hosting/configuration) with `pegboard.preload_max_total_bytes`. In serverless mode, this data is serialized into the `/api/rivet/start` request body along with actor config and protocol metadata, so the accepted body size must be larger than the preload budget. RivetKit defaults `serverless.maxStartPayloadBytes` to 16 MiB to leave margin for the default 1 MiB preload budget and larger SQLite startup page preloads.

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max total preload size | 1 MiB | — | Maximum total size of all preloaded KV data sent with the start command. Configurable via `pegboard.preload_max_total_bytes`. Setting to 0 disables all preloading. |
| Max workflow preload size | 128 KiB | — | Default maximum size of preloaded workflow data for RivetKit actors. Configurable per actor via `options.preloadMaxWorkflowBytes`. Setting to 0 disables workflow preloading for that actor. |
| Max connections preload size | 64 KiB | — | Default maximum size of preloaded connection data for RivetKit actors. Configurable per actor via `options.preloadMaxConnectionsBytes`. Setting to 0 disables connections preloading for that actor. |

### Actor Input

See [Actor Input](/docs/actors/input) for details.

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Max actor input size | — | 4 MiB | Maximum size of the input passed when creating an actor. |
| Max connection params size | — | 4 KiB | Maximum size of connection parameters passed when connecting to an actor. |
| Max actor key component size | — | 128 bytes | Maximum size of each component in an actor key array. |
| Max actor key total size | — | 1,024 bytes | Maximum total size of the serialized actor key string. |
| Max actor name length | — | 64 characters | Maximum length for actor and project identifiers. |

### Rate Limiting

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Rate limit | — | 1200 requests/minute | Default rate limit per actor per IP address with a 1 minute time bucket. |
| Max in-flight requests | — | 32 | Default maximum concurrent requests to an actor per IP address. |

### Timeouts

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Action timeout | 60 seconds | — | Timeout for RPC actions. Configurable via `actionTimeout`. |
| Create vars timeout | 5 seconds | — | Timeout for `createVars` hook. Configurable via `createVarsTimeout`. |
| Create conn state timeout | 5 seconds | — | Timeout for `createConnState` hook. Configurable via `createConnStateTimeout`. |
| On connect timeout | 5 seconds | — | Timeout for `onConnect` hook. Configurable via `onConnectTimeout`. |
| Sleep grace period | 15 seconds | — | Total graceful shutdown budget for both sleep and destroy. Covers `onSleep`/`onDestroy`, run handler shutdown, `waitUntil`, `keepAwake`, async raw WebSocket handlers, and connection cleanup. Configurable via `sleepGracePeriod`. |
| Sleep timeout | 30 seconds | — | Time of inactivity before actor hibernates. Configurable via `sleepTimeout`. |
| State save interval | 10 seconds | — | Interval between automatic state saves. Configurable via `stateSaveInterval`. |

### Serverless Shutdown

These timeouts control how actors are shut down when a serverless request reaches its lifespan limit. See [Shutdown Sequence](/docs/general/runtime-modes#shutdown-sequence) for details.

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Request lifespan | 3600 seconds (60 min) | — | Total lifespan of a serverless request before drain begins. Configurable via `requestLifespan` in [`configurePool`](/docs/general/registry-configuration). |
| Runner config drain grace period | — | 30 minutes | Time a serverless runner reserves for actors to stop gracefully. Configurable via `drainGracePeriod` in [`configurePool`](/docs/general/registry-configuration). |
| Engine serverless drain fallback | — | 10 seconds | Engine-level fallback used when no per-runner config applies. Configurable via [engine config](/docs/self-hosting/configuration) (`pegboard.serverless_drain_grace_period`). |

### Actor Lifecycle

| Name | Soft Limit | Hard Limit | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Actor start threshold | — | 30 seconds | Maximum time for an actor to start before it is considered lost and rescheduled. |
| Actor stop threshold | — | 30 minutes | Maximum time for an actor to stop before it is considered lost. |

## Increasing Limits

These limits are sane defaults designed to protect your application from exploits and accidental runaway bugs. If you have a use case that requires different limits, [contact us](https://rivet.dev/contact) to discuss your requirements.
