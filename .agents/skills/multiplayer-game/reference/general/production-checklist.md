---
We recommend passing this page to your coding agent to verify your configuration before deploying.

## Environment

- **Set `NODE_ENV=production`.** Ensures optimized performance and disables development-only behavior.
- **Ensure log level is not set to debug.** Leave `RIVET_LOG_LEVEL` at its default or explicitly set it to `warn` to avoid excessive logging. See [Logging](/docs/general/logging).
- **Do not set `RIVET_EXPOSE_ERRORS=1` in production.** This exposes internal error details to clients. It is automatically enabled when `NODE_ENV=development`. See [Errors](/docs/actors/errors).

## Runtime Mode

- **Configure a runner version.** Required for graceful upgrades and draining of old actors. Applies to both serverless and runner modes. See [Versions & Upgrades](/docs/actors/versions).

### Serverless

- **Check platform timeouts.** Rivet handles migration between invocations automatically, but shorter timeouts increase migration frequency. See [Timeouts](/docs/general/runtime-modes#timeouts).
- **Verify `/api/rivet/start` body size limits.** Serverless actor starts carry actor config and preloaded KV or SQLite startup data in the request body. Keep `serverless.maxStartPayloadBytes` and your platform or proxy body limit at **16 MiB or higher**, or lower the preload budget if your platform cannot accept that size. See [Limits](/docs/actors/limits#kv-preloading).
- **Configure max runners.** Go to Settings > Providers > Edit Provider > Max Runners to set the limit. The default is 100,000 runners. This is effectively your max actor count.
- **Verify your platform rate limit accommodates your actor create and wake frequency.** Actor start requests are sent from Rivet's servers, so they all originate from the same IP. Per-IP rate limits will throttle the engine well before they would throttle real end-user traffic. Size your platform's rate limit to your peak actor create and wake rate, not your end-user request rate.
- **Configure platform max concurrency if available.** Some platforms (e.g. GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda) let you cap the number of concurrent instances. Set this to match your expected concurrent actor count so the platform admits enough instances to host your actors.

### Runner

- **Set a graceful shutdown period of at least 35 minutes.** Runners need up to 30 minutes to drain actors during upgrades, plus buffer for shutdown overhead. In Kubernetes, set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 2100` on the pod spec.

## Actors

### Design Patterns

- **Do not use god actors.** Avoid putting all logic into a single actor type. See [Design Patterns](/docs/actors/design-patterns).
- **Do not use actor-per-request patterns.** Avoid creating a new actor for each request. See [Design Patterns](/docs/actors/design-patterns).

### Lifecycle

- **Do not rely on `onSleep` for critical cleanup.** `onSleep` is not called during crashes or forced terminations. See [Lifecycle](/docs/actors/lifecycle).

### State

- **Verify `c.state` does not grow unbounded.** Avoid using arrays or objects that grow over time in state. Use [SQLite](/docs/actors/sqlite) for unbounded or append-heavy data instead.
- **Verify actor data does not exceed 10 GB.** Contact [enterprise support](https://rivet.dev/sales) if you need more storage.
- **Use input parameters and `createState` for actor initialization.** See [Input Parameters](/docs/actors/input).

### Events

- **Use `conn.send()` instead of `c.broadcast()` for private events.** `c.broadcast()` sends to all connected clients. Use `conn.send()` to send events to a specific connection. See [Realtime](/docs/actors/events).

### Actions

- **Review action timeout configuration.** The default `actionTimeout` is 60 seconds. Increase it if you have long-running actions like API calls or file processing. See [Actor Configuration](/docs/general/actor-configuration).
- **Review message size limits.** The default `maxIncomingMessageSize` is 64 KiB and `maxOutgoingMessageSize` is 1 MiB. Increase if your actors send or receive large JSON payloads. See [Registry Configuration](/docs/general/registry-configuration).

### Queues

- **Review queue limits.** The default `maxQueueSize` is 1,000 messages and `maxQueueMessageSize` is 64 KiB. Increase if you expect burst traffic or large queue payloads. See [Actor Configuration](/docs/general/actor-configuration).
- **Ensure queue handlers are idempotent.** If processing fails before `message.complete()`, the message will be retried. See [Queues](/docs/actors/queues).

### Workflows

- **Verify workflows do not generate infinite steps.** Use `ctx.loop` to avoid creating unbounded step histories. See [Workflows](/docs/actors/workflows).

## Security

### Authentication

- **Validate connections in `createConnState` or `onBeforeConnect`.** Do not trust client input without validation. See [Authentication](/docs/actors/authentication).

### CORS

- **Configure CORS for production.** Restrict allowed origins instead of allowing all. See [CORS](/docs/general/cors).

### Tokens (Rivet Cloud)

- **Use `pk_*` tokens for `RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`.** Public tokens are safe to expose to clients.
- **Use `sk_*` tokens for `RIVET_ENDPOINT`.** Secret tokens should only be used server-side.
- **Do not leak your secret token.** Never expose `sk_*` tokens in client-side code, public repositories, or browser environments. See [Endpoints](/docs/general/endpoints).
- **Verify you're connecting to the correct region.** Use the nearest datacenter endpoint (e.g. `api-us-west-1.rivet.dev`) for lowest latency.

### Access Control

Access control is only needed if you want granular permissions for different clients. For most use cases, basic authentication in `onBeforeConnect` or `createConnState` is sufficient.

- **Use deny-by-default rules.** Reject unknown roles in `onBeforeConnect`, action handlers, `canPublish`, and `canSubscribe`. See [Access Control](/docs/actors/access-control).
- **Authorize actions explicitly.** Check the caller's role in each action handler and throw `forbidden` for unauthorized access.
- **Gate event subscriptions and queue publishes.** Use `canSubscribe` and `canPublish` hooks to restrict which clients can subscribe to events or publish to queues.

## Clients

- **Dispose connections and/or client when not in use (JavaScript client).** Call `conn.dispose()` or `client.dispose()` when no longer needed to free resources. React and SwiftUI clients handle this automatically. See [Connection Lifecycle](/docs/clients/javascript#connection-lifecycle).
