# Sandbox Actor

> Description: The legacy TypeScript sandbox actor has been removed while the replacement runtime is rebuilt.

---
The legacy TypeScript sandbox actor and provider exports were removed from
`rivetkit` while the replacement runtime is rebuilt.

## Current status

- The `rivetkit/sandbox` package path does not exist on this branch.
- The old `sandbox-agent` wrapper was intentionally deleted.
- The old code examples were removed so the docs stop advertising broken imports.

## What to use instead

- For actor hosting, use `Registry.startEnvoy()` and the native `rivetkit-core`
  path.
- If you still need sandbox orchestration immediately, integrate
  `sandbox-agent` directly in your own application code instead of relying on a
  removed `rivetkit` wrapper.

This page will be replaced when the new runtime lands.
