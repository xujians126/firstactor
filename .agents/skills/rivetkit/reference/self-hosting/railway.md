## Video Tutorial

PostgreSQL is the recommended backend for multi-node self-hosted deployments today, but it remains experimental. For a production-ready single-node Rivet deployment, use the file system backend (RocksDB-based). Enterprise teams can contact [enterprise support](https://rivet.dev/sales) about FoundationDB for the most scalable production-ready deployment.

## Quick Deploy

Choose the template that best fits your needs:

| **Rivet Template** | **Rivet Starter** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet?referralCode=RC7bza&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic) | [![Deploy Rivet Starter](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/rivet-starter) |
| **Blank template** to start fresh | **Complete example** with chat app |
| - Rivet Engine | - Pre-configured Rivet Engine |
| - PostgreSQL database | - Example chat application with Actors |
| - Basic configuration | - PostgreSQL database |
| - Manual setup required | - Rivet Inspector for debugging |
| | - Ready to run immediately |

You can also use the [Rivet Railway template](https://github.com/rivet-dev/template-railway) as a starting point for your application.

After deploying either template, you can find the `RIVET__AUTH__ADMIN_TOKEN` under the **Variables** tab in the Railway dashboard. This token is required to access the Rivet Inspector.

## Manual Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. [Railway account](https://railway.app)
2. [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) (optional)

### Step 1: Create New Project

```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway init

# Or create via dashboard
# https://railway.app/new
```

### Step 2: Add Services

#### Deploy PostgreSQL Database

1. Click "New Service" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Railway automatically provisions and configures PostgreSQL
3. Note the connection string from the service variables

#### Deploy Rivet Engine

1. Click "New Service" → "Docker Image"
2. Set image: `rivetdev/engine:latest`
3. Configure environment variables:
    - `RIVET__POSTGRES__URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
4. Configure graceful shutdown (see [Graceful Shutdown](#graceful-shutdown) below)

### Step 3: Deploy Your Application

Follow the [Railway Quick Start guide](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start) to deploy your repository:

1. Connect your GitHub account to Railway
2. Select your repository containing your Rivet application
3. Railway will automatically detect and deploy your application
4. Configure environment variables for your application:
    - `RIVET_ENDPOINT=${{Rivet.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` - Points to the Rivet Engine service's private domain

## Graceful Shutdown

By default, Railway kills the old deploy 0 seconds after sending `SIGTERM` (see [Railway's docs](https://docs.railway.com/deployments/reference#singleton-deploys)), so in-flight requests are dropped and state flushes can be interrupted on every deploy. Rivet ships with a `SIGTERM` handler that drains cleanly, but it only gets to run if Railway is configured to give it time.

Configure the following under **Settings → Deploy** on your service:

- **Draining seconds** — the grace window between `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL`. This is how long Rivet has to finish in-flight work and flush state. See [Railway's deployment teardown docs](https://docs.railway.com/deployments/deployment-teardown).

Set draining seconds in the dashboard, via `drainingSeconds` in config-as-code, or via the `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_DRAINING_SECONDS` service variable. A reasonable value is **60 seconds**.

If your start command is a wrapper process (for example `npm start`, `yarn start`, `pnpm start`, or a shell script), the wrapper becomes PID 1 and swallows the signal — your app never drains and Railway force-kills it at the end of the window.

- Invoke your binary directly as the start command (for example `node dist/index.js`, not `npm start`).
- Or run `dumb-init` / `tini` as PID 1 in your Dockerfile so signals forward to your process.   

## Next Steps
