# Render Deployment

> Description: Deploy Rivet Engine to Render with managed PostgreSQL and automatic HTTPS, using the experimental PostgreSQL backend.

---
PostgreSQL is the recommended backend for multi-node self-hosted deployments today, but it remains experimental. For a production-ready single-node Rivet deployment, use the file system backend (RocksDB-based). Enterprise teams can contact [enterprise support](https://rivet.dev/sales) about FoundationDB for the most scalable production-ready deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Render account](https://render.com)
2. A GitHub repository

## Deploy Rivet Engine

  
### Create the Blueprint Files

    Add these three files to the root of your GitHub repository:

    **render.yaml**

    ```yaml
    databases:
      - name: rivet-db
        plan: basic-256mb
        databaseName: rivet
        user: rivet

    services:
      - type: web
        name: rivet-engine
        runtime: docker
        dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile.render
        plan: starter
        healthCheckPath: /health
        envVars:
          - key: DATABASE_URL
            fromDatabase:
              name: rivet-db
              property: connectionString
          - key: RIVET__AUTH__ADMIN_TOKEN
            generateValue: true
    ```

    **Dockerfile.render**

    ```dockerfile
    FROM rivetdev/engine:latest

    COPY entrypoint.render.sh /entrypoint.render.sh
    RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.render.sh

    ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.render.sh"]
    ```

    **entrypoint.render.sh**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh

    if [ -n "$DATABASE_URL" ]; then
        export RIVET__POSTGRES__URL="${DATABASE_URL}?sslmode=disable"
    fi

    exec /usr/bin/rivet-engine start
    ```

    Commit and push these files to your repository.
  

  
### Deploy to Render

    1. Go to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
    2. Click **Blueprints** in the left sidebar
    3. Click **New Blueprint Instance**
    4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
    5. Select the repository containing the files from the previous step
    6. Click **Apply**

    Render will automatically create the PostgreSQL database and deploy the Rivet Engine.
  

  
### Get Your Admin Token

    1. Once deployed, go to your **rivet-engine** service in the Render Dashboard
    2. Click the **Environment** tab
    3. Find `RIVET__AUTH__ADMIN_TOKEN` and click the eye icon to reveal the value
    4. Copy this token — you'll need it to access the dashboard
  

  
### Access the Rivet Dashboard

    Open your service URL in a browser:

    ```
    https://rivet-engine-xxxx.onrender.com/ui/
    ```

    Replace `rivet-engine-xxxx` with your actual service name from the Render Dashboard.

    Enter the admin token from the previous step to log in.
  

## Connecting Your Application

To connect a RivetKit application to your self-hosted engine, set these environment variables in your app:

```bash
RIVET_ENDPOINT=https://<namespace>:<admin-token>@rivet-engine-xxxx.onrender.com
RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://<namespace>@rivet-engine-xxxx.onrender.com
```

See the [Connect guide](/docs/connect/custom) for more details on connecting your application.

## Next Steps

- Review the [Production Checklist](/docs/self-hosting/production-checklist) before going live
- See [Configuration](/docs/self-hosting/configuration) for all options
